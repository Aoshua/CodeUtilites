# CodeUtility
Just some useful bash scripts.

### Utilites List:
1. cph (Character Position Highligher) Wraps the character at the given position in `[-> <-]` and shows within line for context.


### Current Limitations:
1. cph
    * The line spacing must be the same; therefore files in single-line format work best.
### Notes:
* I am using WSL2 on my Windows 10 machine to run my bash files.
* As far as I have seen so far, it doesn't matter if bash files written in python have `.sh`, `.py` or even no file extension. 
* After chreating a file with `vi filename.extention` use `chmod 700 filename.extention` to make it an executable file. To run the file simply `./filename anyparams` or `python3 filename anyparams`
